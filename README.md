# traders-guild-native
##Description
The Trader's guild is a web-based solution for listing tradeable items for [Dark and Darker](https://www.darkanddarker.com/).

## Deployment

The live site is currently online [here](https://peaceful-citadel-67422-36a5c387efe8.herokuapp.com/). You can also see the original site [here](https://traders-guild-a1de141fdce9.herokuapp.com/).
The login and home pages are still under development, and there is a known issue regarding the context function used to authenticate users, this means you may need to reload the page after logging in to list items.
